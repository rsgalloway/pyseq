CHANGELOG
=========

v0.4.3
======

* Fixes regex in ``uncompress`` (issue #19)

* Adds brackets to %R directive formatting

* Fixes lss to use cwd when no args/paths are given

* Changes default range delimiter $PYSEQ_RANGE_SEP to a comma

v0.4.2
======

* Adds recursive walk() function, and -r option to lss.

* Adds frame range separator as env var.

* Adds disk usage (%d) directive to formatting.

* Adds insert, extend, and magic methods.

* Fixes lss to support multiple arguments.

v0.4.1
======

* Performance improvement by increasing Sequence._get_missing speed.

* Adds size and mtime properties to Item and Sequence classes.

* Deprecates getSequences(): use get_sequences() instead.

* Deprecates Item.isSibling(): use Item.is_sibling() instead.

* Additional PEP8 updates.

v0.4.0
======

* Some PEP8 and Python 3+ updates.

* Added *unittests* for the whole library (requires python 2.7+).

* The ``format`` parameter is renamed to ``fmt`` in ``uncompress()`` and 
``Sequence.format()`` to not to shadow the **Python built-in**.

* Added a method called ``includes()`` to the ``Sequence`` class that does 
  what the ``contains()`` method was doing in previous versions, that is, it 
  now checks if the given Item could be contained in that particular Sequence.

* Updated ``Sequence.contains()`` method behavior updated to better match its name, 
  that is, it now checks if the Item is contained inside the boundaries of the 
  Sequence.

* The padding characters are now properly interpreted, as shown below::

    seq = Sequence([
        'file.0001.jpg',
        'file.0002.jpg',
        'file.0003.jpg',
        'file.0006.jpg'
    ])

    print(seq.format('%h%04s-%04e%t'))
    # will print 'file.0001-0006.jpg'

    print(seq.format('%h%4s-%4e%t'))
    # will print 'file.   1-   6.jpg'

v0.2.2
======

* Fixed %R in uncompress()

* Fixed minor bug in getSequences() with glob

v0.2.1b
=======

* supports sequences of any serializable, sortable items

* Export diff function to get numeric differences between two sequential files

* Alpha version of uncompress func for deserialization of compressed sequence
  strings.

* Added additional attributes to Item class: path, frame, head, tail

* Item name attribute is now base name, fixes bug where contains method didn't
  work on file paths.

* Moved function 'main' to lss permanently.

* Added --format and --debug options to lss

* Ability to set log level with environment variable $PYSEQ_LOG_LEVEL

* Simplified format directives, e.g. from %(head)s to %h, with support for
  padding, e.g. %04l.

* Fixed duplicate sequence index number bug

* Set logging level with PYSEQ_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

* Added 32 additional test cases.

* Performance improvements.

* Added html docs.

* Added setup.py
