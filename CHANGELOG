v0.4.0
======

* Some PEP8 and Python 3+ updates.
* Added *unittests* for the whole library (requires python 2.7+).
* The ``format`` parameter is renamed to ``fmt`` in ``uncompress()`` and 
``Sequence.format()`` to not to shadow the **Python built-in**.
* Added a method called ``includes()`` to the ``Sequence`` class that does 
  what the ``contains()`` method was doing in previous versions, that is, it 
  now checks if the given Item could be contained in that particular Sequence.
* Updated ``Sequence.contains()`` method behavior updated to better match its name, 
  that is, it now checks if the Item is contained inside the boundaries of the 
  Sequence.
* The padding characters are now properly interpreted, as shown below

    seq = Sequence([
        'file.0001.jpg',
        'file.0002.jpg',
        'file.0003.jpg',
        'file.0006.jpg'
    ])

    print(seq.format('%h%04s-%04e%t'))

  will print 'file.0001-0006.jpg'

    print(seq.format('%h%4s-%4e%t'))

  will print 'file.   1-   6.jpg'

* Export diff function to get numeric differences between two sequential files
* Alpha version of uncompress func for deserialization of compressed sequence
  strings.

* Item name attribute is now base name, fixes bug where contains method didn't
  work on file paths.
* Moved function 'main' to lss permanently.
* Added --format and --debug options to lss
* Ability to set log level with environment variable $PYSEQ_LOG_LEVEL
* Simplified format directives, e.g. from %(head)s to %h, with support for
